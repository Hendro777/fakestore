## About
With the great courses about [React](https://react.dev/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) taught at [scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) by [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll) it was easy to dive into the world of the framework.
After that I wanted to make my own experiences and started this project.
It is solely a frontend project and for it to show some sleek data and pictures I am using [dummyJSON](https://github.com/Ovi/DummyJSON)

At one point I might decide to write my own backend for it.
